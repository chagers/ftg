In an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the salmon, combine olive oil, red-pepper flakes, paprika, fennel seeds, coriander seeds and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and just simmering, about 5 minutes.</li>\n<li>Pat the salmon dry, then sprinkle with salt and place in the spiced oil flesh side up. Spoon some of the oil over the salmon, then bake, basting occasionally, until cooked through, 15 to 25 minutes. (You will know if the salmon is done when the fish flakes when cut into with a knife or fork or when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reaches 120 degrees.)</li>\n<li>While the salmon roasts, peel the cucumber and cut into bite-size pieces. Sprinkle with salt.</li>\n<li>Break the salmon into large pieces on a serving platter. (Alternatively, you can make the salmon in advance, and eat it at room temperature.) Scatter the cucumbers around the salmon, then top with feta and parsley. Drizzle chile oil over everything to taste. (You will have more than you need — dip bread into any remaining oil.)</li>\n</ol>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"spicy-slow-roasted-salmon-with-cucumbers-and-feta"}}}
