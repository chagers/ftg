Simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>\n<li>Add the soy sauce mixture and a generous squeeze of fresh lime juice to taste; you may use the juice of an entire lime.

If desired, serve over jasmine rice.</li>\n</ol>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vegan-thai-curry-vegetables"}}}
